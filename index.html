            <h2>The Importance of Women in Computing to my College Career</h2>

                <p>As a female computer science major it is very easy to feel alone in my classes. I walk into a room of 60 and maybe 4 are female, and that number usually decreases towards the drop date. But one thing I have always noticed, especially as I began TAing in person this semester - those female students, more often than not, gravitate towards one another in class. We find it easier to create bonds with each other, and navigate this degree as a whole. That is why I love being part of Women in Computing, and have been since my freshman year. It’s a club with the sole goal of recruiting and sustaining women in computing fields - a place where people in the major can go and feel supported and united. I have met my best friends through these meetings and I got my internships and subsequent full time job through a conference that was funded by the club. So you could definitely say that Women in Computing has been very beneficial to my college career. I believe that any efforts to encourage minority groups to pursue computing and engineering will be extremely beneficial in the long run, because the more diversity you have, the better perspectives you can build upon.</p>

            <h2>Traveling to Alaska</h2>

                <p>Over the summer, I was fortunate enough to travel to Fairbanks, AK to visit a friend that was interning there. I had never been to Alaska before, so I considered this to be the perfect excuse to make the trip. Getting there was an exhausting experience (especially while still being in the middle of the pandemic and mask mandates), and imagine my surprise when we arrive at midnight AK time and the sun is still up. We traveled during their Midnight Sun season, where there are very little hours of darkness - it was definitely not what I was expecting. During the trip we were able to explore Downtown Fairbanks, Denali National Park, and we got to visit a reindeer ranch. Unfortunately, when we visited Denali it was super cloudy so we couldn’t see the mountain, but it was beautiful nonetheless. The reindeer ranch was the highlight, as we got to visit with and pet over a dozen reindeer in their natural habitat, and have many photo ops along the way. There were so many other places in Alaska that I would’ve loved to visit, but we were only there for 5 days due to work. Overall it was a great experience and I hope to make my way there again and explore all the other places Alaska has to offer!</p>
